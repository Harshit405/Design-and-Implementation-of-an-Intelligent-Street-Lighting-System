# 🌃 Intelligent Street Lighting System with Automated Illumination Control  

## 📌 About the Project  
An **IoT-based intelligent street lighting system** that automatically adjusts illumination based on **ambient light and environmental conditions**. It enhances **energy efficiency**, reduces wastage, and ensures **safe urban lighting**.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🌞 Automatic ON/OFF based on daylight.  
- 🌙 Adaptive brightness during low-light conditions.  
- 🚗 Motion/vehicle detection for smart brightness control (optional).  
- ⚡ Low power consumption using LEDs.  
- 🌍 Scalable for smart city applications.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Hardware:** Arduino/ESP32, LDR Sensor, IR/Ultrasonic Sensors, Relays, LEDs  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, C/C++  
- **Domain:** IoT, Embedded Systems, Smart Cities  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
1. **LDR Sensor** detects ambient light.  
2. System switches **OFF** during daytime.  
3. At night/dusk, **lights turn ON** automatically.  
4. Optional sensors detect vehicles/pedestrians → full brightness.  
5. Lights dim when idle → **energy saving**.
